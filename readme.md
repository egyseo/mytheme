# Mytheme   

A custom Wordpress theme created from the design available 
on  [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/blog/). This theme is creeated as a learning process of custom Wordpress developement. In it, I have tried to utilize all the useful features offered by Wordpress CMS.
This theme includes a homepage, archives and single post page. 

I used styles from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/blog/) example and used Bootstrap framework for Frontend.

I used the following WordPress features.
  - Enquering Styles and Scripts
  - Creating and using UI Templates
  - Creating Custom Front page
  - Created and used Custom WP Loops (multiple loops on same page)
  - Implemented Custom Pagination
  - Implemented Search
 
Following are some of the things that were a challenge.
- Creating a Banner Post with full background image 
- Creating Featured Posts below the Banner Post
- Looping and Presenting other posts
- Pagination on posts
- Implementing custom search form
- Creating archives link
- Showing individual post
- Customizing Comments section
